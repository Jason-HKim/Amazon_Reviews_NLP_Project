 as the technology the typical user has access to improves   and it makes cheating more difficult  but users who have slower connections will start to feel the gap at endgame in the form of lag  the

never seen anything quite like it in a shooter  and the momentum gained by connecting consecutive wall jumps and runs can evoke the satisfaction of a successful run in mirror s edge  the ability to

empowerment of a titan  though  rocketing out of the sky like a meteor  they can cleverly instantly kill enemies  including titans  on impact  and are incredibly satisfying to pilot  punches to

the purpose of guidance  and are not suitable for end game  end game builds require you to dabble in multiple weapon trees and finding the right combination of abilities and gears can be a very time

times in the past few years  but after spending a few hours to get the beginning of the story out of the way the game just feels kind of   lonely   the hype for this game is gone   the characters and environments don t have as much depth as the newer games coming out  and maps are pretty small as far as exploration goes   very linear story paths   there is also a definite feel of isolation with extremely long single path dungeons and slow battles which make me feel a bit claustrophobic and annoyed   the music  story  voice acting  and environments are imaginative and a a joy as always  but

fill in the narrative  it was also nice that there were some different kinds of objects that were appropriate to the period     first the bad   it s not a hard hog  the objects are generally fairly easy to find  the hints are liberal and i never got an over clicking penalty  oh  and the mini games are incredibly lame    but there aren t that many so it doesn t really matter  mostly  they re there to make some bonus points     that being said  this game offered a couple of innovative changes from most hogs that were great  one is the use of some motion ho scenes    ie  you re in a car driving along while finding hidden objects  or following a camera pan along some scenery during some narration  pretty cool     the best new thing was the introduction of a library trophy room  the library houses your achievement trophies  but you can also spend points to add artwork  furniture  lighting  etc to it  you gain points from gameplay  and can earn bonus points by collecting certain books and finding letters to spell words  very satisfying to end the game having a look at all the trophies and a nicely decked out library    it adds some replay value  too  if you didn t get

 br    br   i think a lot has been said and done about this game  some hate the ending  some like them but both sides have raised good points  i for one liked the ending  and i did not play with the extended cut dlc  and found it to be very cinematic  the games fps play thorough ends     minutes earlier and than you have about   minutes or so of interactive cut scenes where you will decide how the story wraps up  without trying to spoil it but sometimes in life especially in the world of books movies you are up against hopeless odds and a sacrifice has to be made for the greater good  this aspect is what bioware had tried to capture in the finale of the game and i think they succeeded  if you are expecting a grand fps confrontation with the final boss in which everyone walks happily after downing the boss well than you might be disappointed but if you want to experience being against a impossible scenario and feeling truly hopeless than you might get to appreciate the way bioware decided to end the game  br    br   other than the endings this is a true mass effect game  you have a great sci fi fps shooter rpg where the story is the central focus not just mowing down mobs and picking up bigger   badder weapons  the gameplay is seamlessly combined with interactive cut scenes which truly gives this game that interactive movie feel which had been the hallmark of the mass effect universe  also the game brings closure to many of the sub plots and to some major characters and in my view this aspect of the game was very well handled  multiple times through the game i thought real hard as to who i will side with or which decision i should make because of the emotional attachment i developed to those characters or sub plots etc  br    br   i will highly recommend the game and will truly miss this great series  i will also advise that you get the extended cut dlc which is a free download as i have heard it greatly improves   clarifies the endings which is the

 running up buildings can be frustrating during chase sequences  but unless you re a spastic chimpanzee  it shouldn t be too much of a problem  the claims of poor optimization also do not hold much

interested in connor s story and desmond s sometimes disrupted the immersion  are the cutscenes as excessive as many claim  as someone who s played quite a few games that require reading walls of text  the cutscenes here were a cakewalk for me and i happened to very much enjoy the exposition they provided  my only real gripe with the game is that many of the optional objectives presented in each mission are next to impossible  and seeing a red x at the end of a sequence can be disheartening  combat felt cluttered stilted at times and relied too much on counters  but as my skill improved  it became a much smoother and more enjoyable process  the combo takedowns and kill animations provided some decent satisfaction  br    br   the american revolution is an overlooked subject in video games

downloaded fine and works fine on my windows      not sure why so many people are having problems with that but it starts and plays just fine for me  one thing i did notice and have read about in the

   br   the only frustration i found with this game were with the enemies  it seems that every enemy seems is a sharpshooter  whether they are shooting with a machine gun  shotgun  bow and arrow  or throwing grenades or molotovs  and no matter how far away they are  they always seem to be dead on every time  it can get very frustrating when dealing with more than a few enemies at a time  or even when you re behind cover  you will think you are hiding  but then get hit with a molotov from across the map  which will push you out into the open while everyone else is shooting at you  br    br   you start to feel like you re playing pinball and you re the ball  i would love to see an update in the future where the enemies at least miss sometimes  but i guess they countered that by adding the dodge system  br    br   speaking of which  the dodge system works alright  it does what it s supposed to  but when there are a lot of enemies you spend more time ducking and rolling all over than you do actually attacking  you can t stay still  even behind cover  for very long because so much is coming at you at once  br    br   the cover system is alright  i found it weird that there s no crouch button  so the only time you can take cover is when the game says you can  there were some moments where i wanted to crouch and sneak up to an enemy  but the game didn t put me in the position  so the enemies ended up seeing me  although there are stealth kills in the game  i don t think the game was ever supposed to have stealth as a focus  unfortunate for me  because i m so used to these kinds of games having at least a moderate amount of stealth focus  br    br   another thing about enemies that i would expect to be absent from all games nowadays is the fact that enemies always know exactly where you are  there was a moment in a very dark  very wide forest  where i tried to shoot a grenade at a wall and i missed  so after it exploded i ran to hide in some tower  and all of the enemies that wereleft in that area knew exactly where to start shooting  even though none of them were even close by when the grenade went off  most games like this nowadays have some kind of system where if

megs ram  and a gig video card  the card i have still isnt enough to play the game on high settings    i used ultra on wow   trion  the owner of rift has a applet that you can download from the website that will test your system  i highly suggest you use it  it said i needed to upgrade my video card  i would agree  the site is riftgame com  i simply lowered some of the video settings and it runs fine  so onto the game  the first thing you will notice is the graphics are far better than world of warcraft s  rendering and texturing are just amazing  world detailing and plantings are realistic  spell graphics are great as well  game mechanics are close to wow s  talent tree s are set up the same way  but rift added roots to them  this gives you new abilities as you level higher  which is nice  when creating your character  you have so many choices  the facial features are very life like  everyting is custommizable in rift  which gives the game a much better feel than other games  every setting can be changed to what u would like  there are two factions called guardians and defiant  alliance and horde   within the two are   races  you can pick from   main difference between rift and wow is rifts can open up around you  you normally see them before hand  mobs then appear which you should kill  hence the name  then return to questing  rift has pvp  dungeons  and pve rp servers  you can pick which one you want to play on during the loggin screen  only issue i have had is lagging in the main city  like dalaran in  wow  other lagging occurs because of large number of players doing the world rifts  not blaming trion for that   once you figure the game mechanics out it is well worth the money and time  bottom line is if you love world of warcraft  which i did  then  you will love rift  both games are excellent and offer different play styles  thanks for reading this  zephian", "i know this game is old  but i am having a really good time   if you love

released another the sims game amid angst and anger by the sims community   this of course is quite a bit like the controversy when the sims   came out and possibly the sims     each new release has been punctuated by player frustration not wanting to have to buy another base game and then have to purchase expansions again as they come out in order to enjoy new content     this new base game  however  is a striking change from prior releases in that it actually shakes up the gameplay somewhat   you can see by the number of stars and infer from the title that i believe this to be a good game  but let s get into some of what is in this game that is new  the same  and missing from previous incarnations     the main thing to know about this game is it is largely a return to basics   by now  the sims   is so bloated with features  not only from its expansions  but from features carried over from prior sim games   rather than adding in broken or poorly implemented ideas to this game  maxis ea has opted to slash features that never worked right or weren t fun     pools weren t fun     toddlers weren t fun  people  stop complaining     story progression and neighborhood play has always been controversial among fans of the series and was never very well optimized   seriously  take some time out of your day and search for game breaking bugs in the sims     without mods  you couldn t maintain a save file for too long before it began to fall apart under the weight of the game s design flaws       first off  the new       emotions  this has been hyped for a long time during the development of the game and i feel i m probably like most people in that i had no idea what that meant in a gameplay sense   now i do   it s a wonderfully dynamic system that allows your sims to fluctuate between a few different emotional states depending on his recent experiences   experiences still create moodlets like in previous releases  but these mootlets have an emotion tiedto them   get enough moodlets of a certain type and your sim will begin to feel a certain way   flirt and engage in frequent romantic interaction and your sim will become flirty   play chess and use a telescope and your sim will become focused   there are several examples and they all add to the new  more dynamic gameplay as you interact with other sims and objects   your emotion will determine the success of certain interactions as well as what wants your sim will generate     objective based group interactions  now  instead of just having a general objective of    keep your date happy    or    keep your party guests happy     the outing is more objective based  and thus  more fun and more clear on what you need to do to have success   you get an overall progress meter at the top of the screen and a small list of objectives   meet those objectives to increase the meter and get more objectives   keep going until you max it out   continue to date or party until things run their course and you ll have had an epic experience   the only complaint i ll give with this system is the objectives aren t randomized nor do they draw from a larger pool of potential requirements   they are always the same objectives in a sequence   there should be more randomization and the possibility of different objectives each time you have a group activity     overhauled objective based job progression   the same as above  and similar to the sims    in order to progress in your job  you need to meet a small list of objectives   sometimes you might need to befriend a certain number of people  gain some skill points  or win some chess matches   what i find fun about it is it encourages you to go out and perform interactions with your sim you may have not done otherwise without a gameplay benefit to do so     multitasking    this is a wonderful new feature that allows you to engage in more than one action at a time meaningfully   previously you could have your sim sit and chat while eating  but now you can engage in many of the same social interactions while sitting as you could standing   your sim can carry his plate of food with him while engaged in some other activity if it s compatible with eating   up to three things can be done at once in this game allowing for a variety of interactions and  well  multitasking       now some improved features   i ll try to be brief with these because they are many       improved pregnancy  similar to how the making of babies was improved from the sims     to the sims   by adding actual intercourse and pregnancy  the sims   vastly improves things with some very small changes   you won t know your sim is pregnant unless you get a pregnancy test  or just wait    also  pregnancy doesn t slap you with automatic days off from work that you can t reject   this is a huge improvement if you have a career minded mom sim   previously  a baby would cause you to miss   or more days of work  which was huge for a sim with a work related aspiration     improved skills  what this game may lack in career options it makes up for in skills   you can gain skills in most anything you have your sim do  which adds a fun level of role play previous games had only begun tapping into at later expansions     needs decrease faster and are better  this might not seem like a positive  since it is specifically something that makes the game harder   well  that s a good thing  in my opinion   you could usually get by eating once a day in the sims     in this one  you pretty much need to get your   square meals and a good night s sleep   you actually have to make your sim have fun   sims   needs were almost entirely superfluous aside from bladder  energy  and hunger   however  because of the way moodlets have been overhauled  you won t automatically be slapped with a bad moodlet just because you didn t get a full night s sleep   and you have to be completely out of fun in order to feel its negative effect     babies are better   babies now have a ton more fun interactions  including breastfeeding  which was long overdue    they are now treated as objects as they were before the sims    which is for the better   the sims   treated them like uncontrollable sims who could be kidnapped by babysitters and guests  or set down in a public lot and lost forever   now the crib your baby and you can keep him safe at home   best of all  no toddler stage  more on that later      build mode just keeps getting better  this is a given   i spent some time using money cheats to see how it felt to build a mansion and honestly  i don t have a whole lot to say about it because it s as good as you d expect from the next the sims game   build and buy mode has been the one consistent improvement in the sims series from game to game   one standout feature for this build buy mode is that build mode and buy mode are fully integrated with each other   you don t need to switch between modes anymore   thanks  this was long overdue       missing     when i talk about things that are missing  i m only going to be referring to things that had been a part of the base game in previous sims releases       toddlers  the toddler stage of development is gone   this was just a time sink introduced by the sims   and didn t contribute anything positive to gameplay   as far as gameplay challenge was concerned  all it really did was put you through an endurance test for your sim to try to teach your toddler to speak  walk  and potty in   days   now the game pushes you right into childhood which is much better   plus childhood is better now with its own set of achievements and wishes that pertain to childhood     pools are gone  this seems like a strange one  and i have mixed feelings about it   one the one hand  the fact that they would release this game without pools feels like a big oversight   it s been a standard decoration since the first game   on the other hand  pools are pointless   they are indeed primarily decoration   in real life pools may be fun and a good source of exercise   in the sims  they ve never been good for exercise  their fun is negligible  and they contain limited and shallow social interactions   there is absolutely no reason to doubt they ll be added later in an expansion  probably in the   equivalent of seasons   but if they are holding it back in order to improve on how pools work in the game  i am fine with waiting   to be honest  i m more bummed about spas being gone   they had much better social interactions  were fun group activities  and you could make babies in them   like pools  though  they ll probably be back with a future expansion     no cars  here s where i start to come against the sims     missing vehicles feels more noticeably absent than pools or toddlers   to go anywhere  your sim uses the phone to travel  implying they are calling a cab   however  no cab comes  and your sim more or less teleports to the location   it s speedy  i ll grant you  but having your own car was a nice vanity item for you sim and had enjoyable options   hopefully this will be implemented with an expansion     color customization is back to basics   this is a tragedy  i ll just come out and say it   this was seriously one of the best things about the sims   and it has been removed from this game   no longer can i retexture my entire kitchen set to look like it s made of carpet or have a brooding teenager with an entirely black bedroom lit with a black light   i don t believe this is one we ll get back  however  i could be wrong       the iffy       create a sim  for the most part i like the new create a sim   i especially like the new look of the sims  opting again for a more animated look over the attempted realism of the sims    which never came out very well without mods    the ability to grab certain features on the sim s face or body and adjust it is useful  but not so much as the only way to adjust those features   for general fixes and quick adjustments  this is fine  but we really still need the slider bars for fine tuning   i will say  however  the ability to adjust certain parts of the body  such as the thickness of the legs  arms  size of the butt or breasts or width of the shoulders really offers the ability to make your sim look very individualized     career rewards  i like careers a lot better in this game than in other versions of the sims   advancing has more specific objectives to meet than before and can be fun to complete   and almost every advancement comes with a reward of some kind   some of these are practical  but most of them are just decoration   the gimmick with these rewards is that they can impose a certain emotion on the room they are in   this is cute  but ultimately a little underwhelming   i d rather have more costumes  vehicles  which are absent   or money  etc     group conversations  so when you go to a bar or other public place  your conversations with individual people can quickly become group conversations if there are other people nearby performing similar actions as you are doing   this can add an interesting dynamic  but can occasionally become awkward   for example  flirt with your date while on group conversation mode  and the other group members may get weirded out       bottom line       i purchased this game a few days after release before reading any press on it aside from some of what was released during development   all in all  i am happy with this new release of the sims   it is a return to basics and as a core game upon which to build expansions  this is a solid foundation upon which to build   it is more fun than the sims   and more playable than the sims     this game opens and runs so fast and so smoothly   every transition or save takes seconds compared to the literal minutes it took in the sims       shifting over  though  i will admit that  like every core game release thus far  it doesn t adequately replace the previous game if you own many of the expansion packs   i still have the sims   installed on my computer for the time being  just as i still had the sims   installed when the sims   came out  and the sims for the sims     i meant what i said  it s more fun that the sims    but in all honestly  it is not as fun as the base game for the sims     the neighborhood play was so interesting and unique that this game being as scaled back as it is feels smaller in comparison   nevertheless  when choosing between playing from a fully expanded sims   and vanilla sims    i usually choose the latter due to slow  unwieldy

loaded photo  or live capture camera   you get everything you would expect in an adequate but robust paint program with an ability to save export your work   there is also video capture to watch the works take shape   a decent cartoonist could do alot with this program as the move captures the movement of the arm while drawing well  but it can get sticky near the edges of your screen if you aren t at the perfect distance   on top of all of the painting sound and music is made while you draw with your cursor having its own specific adjustable synth sfx sound   this aspect is fun for awhile and adjusting the bgm brings some variation depending on the genre picked   that is the meat of the game however as challenge mode is really just   drawings that you paint in time with background music

you follow it exactly like eba  hence the beat in the title i suppose   the game is more concerned with rhythm than tracing an exact line which the tutorial doesn t really make clear   there are also   minigames that can be played multiplayer which involve filling the screen  connecting colors and making a long line   for a small price you get a decent paint program and a good move demo that kids should find particularly engaging  just don t expect much of the actual game aspect as it is over quick   the ability to photograph your own coloring book pages and load them   among other creative

special   i picked this up and after   minutes or so  i could not put it down   this game is unbelievable   the premise is that you are an individual getting phone calls with cryptic messages to go an clean up places  which is code for taking the bad guys out at a certain location   you can go in silently and kill the enemies with multiple melee weapons  knives  baseball bats  bricks  etc    or you can go in with different gun weapons  but once you shoot the weapon you alert all the enemies  who come looking for you   one shot or hit from the enemy and you are dead   you will die in this game a lot   but that will make you determined to try and try again   you get a lot of satisfaction when you do succeed to the next level  br    br   the story is weird but it also rather interesting   it is confusing on purpose   there is a reason for all the senseless killing and there is variety in the levels   be aware that for the   graphics  the enemies\u2019 deaths can still seem a little gruesome   the game even switches things around about     of the way through the game   the soundtrack for this game is phenomenal  very reminiscent of the   bit era  br    br   in the game you get to wear numerous animal masks   each masks gives you different abilities   for example  one could give you an instant kill with your fists  one could give you super speed  and on   you get these masks as you play  giving you more incentive to see what your next mask will be like   if you choose to collect hidden letters  you get to see the \u201creal\u201d ending   i recommend playing it through without collecting  and then replaying levels to collect them  br   you will start off the game dying non stop   in fact  there is a trophy for dying over some many times   you will most likely get it   after several hours with the game  i would still die quite a bit  but i learned the game and adapted for example  i would shoot in one place  drawing the enemies out   and hiding in other places  br    br   i have played this game on both   and ps vita   i found that this game is more suited for the vita on the go   i ended up playing this more on the vita   i can\u2019t wait for hotline miami    wrong

original playstation s debut  resident evil was released and i fell in love   now being a veteran re player i can tell you those feelings still haven t changed when i pick up my controller to play this wonderful hd remake   since the remake of re on gamecube  the graphics have improved drastically  there is more to the story  more to the horror and much more to the survival  so beware   this hd remake of the gamecube release brings guts and glory in high definition and in     surround sound   aspect ratios can now be changed from     to     if desired and the old tank controls of the original game have been lifted to more modernize controls    but the tank controls are still available if you want them   new costumes for the characters are given when you continue to play through

from the beginning  and even though you only have one safe house  if you remember where the safe houses are in gta  iv  you can still store cars in their parking spots     i didn t like the motorcycle handling in gta  iv  so i was thinking i wouldn t like tlad   i was wrong   it didn t take long to get used to it  and it was actually fun to ride around with the gang   i definitely liked tbogt the best though   the added ability to replay missions is nice  i wish they would have added that to tlad and gta  iv     if you like to customize your controls like i do  it does suffer from the same weird control binding issues gta  iv does   the right mouse button for example  even if you bind it to another function  it will still hang up the phone when pressed     if you have a modern pc with a current gpu  it should run just fine   i played the original gta  iv on an amd             dual core  with   ram and a geforce gtx   running windows xp   i used high settings and turned shadows down low and it ran just fine     my current system  an intel core          quad core     ram and gtx   plays the game with all settings on very high  detail and view distance set to   and vehicle density

are pretty easy to find  with the exception of one or two in each chapter that are next to impossible  so that keeps it interesting   also a little new  to me   is that some of the objects you need to find are animated  so be aware you may need to grab hold of something scurrying by     the mini games are pretty simple  of the jigsaw puzzle  matching tiles variety  and can be skipped with no penalty   each chapter allows you five hints which refresh after each chapter   the chapters are timed  but i never came close to  needing all the time allotted so it s not particularly stressful

of mmos  and the gameplay is not terribly difficult   i also like that there is a very large map and the storyline is fairly easy to follow especially due to the cut scenes that include your character

crafting things  discovering recipes vs buying them  and figuring out what to do when you first start the game   the only help you get at the beginning is your character s story line and even that is a little bit difficult to pick up on at first  br    br   also i think that the inventory bags themselves and how that all works is a little confusing  at least it was to me at first as i had nobody to explain to me and there wasn t really a help tutorial that was easy to digest mentally  br    br   the armor skins are also pretty awful unless you spend real cash to buy the ones they put true effort into   then again i have played games where the majority of the women were scantily clad and the men all looked like they just stepped out of a   video so  dreamers will dream  br    br   the

the early   when the first one hit the pc  it was unlike anything i d played  and i had fun trying to save the lemmings from uncertain doom  no matter how many tries it took  or how impossible it seemed  unfortunately  there have been many iterations of the original over the years  to the point where there haven t been a whole lot of really new or different titles  even the psp version was the original with a fresh coat of paint  but with this  you re finally getting a new lemmings game  that s right  you will not be seeing    just dig     for the first level  or any level for that matter  everything here is completely new and original  and even the gameplay s changed a little bit     if you ve never played a lemmings game before  this new version might not be the best to start off with  but if you like puzzle games at all  you ll probably have fun  you guide the lemmings to their home  located in each level  while finding ways around various traps and obstacles  but you never control the lemmings directly  you have to make them do certain things since they re constantly walking right  unless they walk into a wall  then they turn around  if there s a gap that they could call into  have one build a staircase over it  if the exit is behind a chain link fence  have a lemming punch their way through it  originally  you d be given a set number of each ability  but here you have to get the ability as well  wherever it may be in the level  an example being that some levels might have you start with just one attribute  but you get the others via using a climber to scale a wall where more skills are located  there s still a time limit for each level  and also a number of lemmings that must be rescued  if you don t meet the requirements  you don t beat the level  you need to meet these requirements in order to move on     aside from having to get some of the attributes  everything s the same  you move a pointer around the level to select lemmings and scroll the map  and you can zoom in and out to get a better look at things  if you played the psp version  it s nearly identical to that  this installment of lemmings has   levels for each of the   difficulties  fun  tricky  taxing and mayhem  rather than the traditional    but for the price  it s not a rip off at all  there s also trophy support  and scoreboards too  some of the records people have are insane  and it s good to see there s still love for the lemmings     if you were hesitant to buy this  thinking it might be the same game again  don t worry about it  and buy the game now  it s basically the same lemmings you remember  but with a face lift and a slight change in gameplay  and hey  you get a trophy for blowing up   lemmings ", "ideally what i needed  thanks a lot ", "this

objects it is noticeable on my    br      inaccurate voice casting   the main guy is supposed to be from new york in    people from ny in   did not talk with a modern day california accent  they spoke with a distinct new york accent  see  franklin roosevelt   br      cpus other than elizabeth are not exciting  irrational games was good with the elizabeth cpu   its cool that she doesn t need to be told what to do  and she s actively looking around in her environment  but what would take this further is having all the cpus in the game be like that  for example  when i steal a drink or food from the cart  i expect people to react  when i listen in on a conversation about a guy buying hot dogs  i expect him to eventually buy and eat it  not just standing around being scripted  that part needs some work  fallout for example  does this quite well  i can easily interact with any npc  and all my actions have consequences  irrational should learn a bit from bethesda in the npc department   but can you imagine them doing a game together  would be awesome   br    br   overall the game is pretty good  but once we have all the cpus function exactly like humans do   randomly then thats the future of gaming i think  br      the game is short  like   hours  with little replay value  thats a general trend of modern games  and one i don t like  what happened to games like ultima or prince

remembered it  br    br   plot  you re a doctor who has been called to see to an ailing patient at the white wolf hotel  up in the mountains  inclement weather strands you at the hotel with a handful of other guests  who just happen to all share ties to the hotel s past as a health resort for orphaned ill children  as you re trying to locate your new patient   people start dying  there s a murderer on the loose  and the more you try to figure out what s happening and why  the more the body count rises  it turns out the killer has a connection to the hotel s past and its guests  as well   and that includes you  br    br   one interesting tidbit i should mention  there is zero supernatural element to this game  which  in my experience  is pretty unusual for such games  despite that  which for me would almost always be a downside   the game is still pretty interesting  perhaps i found it more so as i like to write fiction about police characters and crimes  plus the gruff sheriff in the game reminds me a bit of a gruff sheriff character of mine  i have a soft spot for murder police mysteries  even though the protagonist in this one is a doctor  br    br   the animation and graphics are pretty good  every time someone is murdered  you re treated to a series of abrupt and extreme closeup shots of their lifeless body  though the cutscenes and voiceovers are a bit cheesy and melodramatic  whenever somebody died before my eyes i usually found myself laughing  this just added to the entertainment value in my opinion  however  this game is like a guilty pleasure with how cheesy it can be  though i recall that the first time i played it  when i had the notion that i might be able to save somebody if i was just quick enough  coming across victim after victim was quite harrowing  was there nothing i could do to helpanyone   br    br   a couple of interesting variants on gameplay  when you interact with characters  you re often  though not always  presented with two ways in which you can question respond to them  a polite way and a hostile way  both times i played i chose the polite way  though i imagine the game would play out the same either way  also  hidden object scenes feature a sort of circle of circles  like a rotary phone dial  and you have to find all the objects shown in the circles  there are often more than one of a particular object and it doesn t matter which one you select  once the objects are found  you re presented with an item you can use  gameplay and puzzles aren t terribly difficult   a few times i had to consult the online walkthrough  but not so much as for it to become frustrating  br    br   the hotel s crime s backstory struck me as a bit muddled and confusing  though perhaps this was just me  some of the childhood photos were kind of unbelievable given their connection to the plot  i can t say more  but perhaps you ll notice the same   however  the biggest downside of this game is   there s no collector s edition     which means no bonus content  the main game is all you get  this is unfortunate  as  while the game doesn t technically end on a cliffhanger  it does end pretty abruptly  and in a very unpleasant fashion  i can t go into detail   and i think it would ve been awesome for a followup chapter or even a second full game in which the main character can try to resolve the unfortunate issues the ending brings about  this strikes me as a big missed opportunity for both developers and players  there could be so much more to this story  br    br   oh  i should mention as well that this game features themes of violence  of course   though bloodshed is minimal  the bodies are more creepy and startling than anything   and there is also occasional adult language  none of the really bad curse words  though   br    br   this game definitely isn t high art  but like i said  it s a nice melodramatic escape from fantasy and supernatural themed games  and could perhaps even make a good novella  what do you say  game developers  could there ever be a followup in which the good doctor can set things right     br    br   i obtained my copy of    mountain crime  requital    on dvd

them now ", "awesome gift cards ", "if you re ever going to purchase one of these games download trial      i bought this one and it downloads but it s impossible to open the file to play it    i ve e mail playrix several times to no avail    amazon won t refund help either      i ve downloaded other games  from iwin  with no problem     ", "alot of fun  works very well using a corded xbox   controller   would be alot better with a steering wheel ", "very entertaining", "gain higher levels for your characters and new maps   this is well worth the money for those that are already spending hours playing destiny   obviously  if you haven t put much time into it  then you would not get as much out of it  br    br   the initial expansion  the dark below  focuses on the hive race and adds story missions  strikes and more importantly a raid that yields gear that can get you legendary armor with light   attributes  allowing characters to max out at     level          without the expansion  getting to level   is possible  i believe    in addition  more bounty slots become available making it easier to gain experience by working on more of them at one time  br    br   the second expansion  house of wolves   was recently announced and looks to focus on the fallen   the details for that expansion aren t    clear yet  so what new equipment or activities will become available when it goes live are yet to be determined  br    br   essentially  buying this expansion pass saves some money for those that would buy both expansion separately anyway ", "worked great", "game came as promised with everything included and works great  it hasnt froze or given me any problems  it was delivered on time and the price was more than fair", "i gave far cry   a fair shake on the   a while back and never could get over the absolutely horrible framerate  so during a sale i picked up the pc version  plugged in my wireless   controller  and hooked my desktop up to my big screen to give this another shot  glad i did  game is an absolute blast  perfect  nope  far from it  but about as fun an open world shooter as i ve played ", "good game ", "games seems pretty good  half way through and the actions keeps going  i miss the old style of the first games  but the flash backs to ny are awesome  i d recommend it ", "everything seemed fine  buy and download is safe  trusted and fast  hotel giant   is a great game i love it ", "i bought it as a gift for friends  i like the game  i find educational and creative  she uses it as a decorative tool  the purchase was quick and only downloaded games was delighted with the three  i found a great price  thank you "], "meta": ["Xbox $5 Gift Card - Xbox 360 Digital Code", "Xbox Live Subscription", "Kingdoms of Amalur +
